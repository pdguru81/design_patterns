The methods inherited by the different classes specify different behaviors such that a strategy pattern
is much better to use than  sub-classing/inheritance. Note that the emphasis here are on class methods that are inherited from
parent classes.

Instead of sub_classing to share method's algorithms. We can de-couple those algorithms and make them a separate entity
independent of objects. This gives incredeible fllxibility to combine these algorithms  new objects.
